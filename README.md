# Eval-Guru ✍️

Evaluation Guru is an AI-powered exam evaluator that helps you upload question papers, start exams with a timer, and submit handwritten answer sheets for automatic scoring and feedback. It uses OCR to read answers and AI to grade them instantly.

Eval Guru allows students to attempt random previous year question papers (PYQs), write their answers within a timer (just like a real exam), and then upload their answer sheets. The platform uses AI to evaluate the answers and gives a score out of 70 along with proper feedback, just like a teacher. It also saves your exam history so you can track your progress over time. With features like random PYQ selection, a real exam timer, AI-generated results, and detailed evaluation reports, Eval Guru helps students practice smartly and improve with every test.
